# Analyzing-Covid-19-vaccines-tweets
This project aimed to extract tweets from twitter, cleaning them, store them and analyzing them

I used tweepy library to extract tweets, used MySQL and Cassandra to store the cleaned data, then used python and traditional learning alogrithmes to visualize and analyze data
